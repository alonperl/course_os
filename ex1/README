Task 1.

Running WhatIDo without parameters:

dup(2) duplicates stderr file descriptor to a new file descriptor that gets 
lowest numbered unused descriptor (3 in our case). Now if we print something to 
3 it will output to stderr.

fcntl(3, F_GETFL) performs F_GETFL operation on the (previously duplicated) 
descriptor: gets its access mode and status flags, returns a numerical value of
file status flags. (strace prints also the meaning of that numerical value - in
our case 0_RDWR and 0_LARGEFILE).

brk(0) tries to change current break value to the argument but since it is 0 it
is not valid at any time so the brk(0) returns the current break value.

brk(0x1d2f000) (the argument in your program is relative to current break) tries
to change current break value to the argument and succeeds and thus returns new 
break value.

fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 0), ...}) gets file status 
by descriptor (first arg) and puts the result in the second arg (special 
struct), where we explicitly set the st_mode and st_rdev fields. Returns zero if
succeed.

mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) creates
a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling process. First 
argument is NULL therefore the kernel chooses the starting address of the 
mapping. Second arg is the desired length of the mapping. Third arg is the 
memory protection which is read/write in our case. Fourth arg sets the mapping 
to be invisible to other processes (MAP_PRIVATE) and also sets it to be not 
backed up by any file and is initialized to zeros (MAP_ANONYMOUS). Fifth -1 is 
just a required settlement for such an anonimity. Seventh arg 0 is ignored in 
the case of anonimity, but in other cases specifies offset. Returns the address 
of the new mapping.

lseek(3, 0, SEEK_CUR) tries to reposition the offset of the open file, yet 
setting offset (2nd arg) to zero is useful to check if the reference file is 
capable of seeking. Here it is not as fd=3 in our case is stderr which is a 
terminal device. Thus returned -1 and set errno to ESPIPE.

write(3, "Only a single argument is suppor"..., 36) tries to write given string,
up to 36 bytes to fd=3 (stderr), and succeeds and thus returns 36 (the number of
bytes written).

write(3, ": Success\n", 10) - same here.

close(3) closes fd=3 file.

munmap(0x7ff722910000, 4096) unmaps the mapped memory from given address of 
given length. Returns 0 if succeeds.

exit_group(0) exits all threads of the process.

Running WhatIDo with an arbitrary argument:

mkdir("os", 0775) creates a folder “os” (first arg) in current folder and gives it 
775 permissions (second arg) (rwxrwxr-x). Returned 0 on success.

mkdir("os/2015", 0775) creates a folder “2015” inside the folder “os” which should 
be in current folder (first arg) and gives it 775 permissions (second arg) (rwxrwxr-x). 
Returned 0 on success.

brk(0) tries to change current break value to the argument but since it is 0 it
is not valid at any time so the brk(0) returns the current break value.

brk(0x12df000) (the argument in your program is relative to current break) tries
to change current break value to the argument and succeeds and thus returns new 
break value.

open("os/2015/info", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) opens file named “info” that 
should be in the folder “os/2015” relatively to current folder, for write only (O_WRONLY), 
if the file does not exist creates it, if it exists and is regular file and is writable - 
truncates it (deletes all the content), if new file created - sets its permissions to 666 
(rw-rw-rw-). Returns file descriptor (lowest available) (3 in this case).

fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) gets file status 
by descriptor (first arg) and puts the result in the second arg (special 
struct), where we explicitly set the st_mode (IFREG = regular file) and 
st_size fields. Returns zero if succeed.

mmap(NULL, 65536, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) - a new mapping 
in the virtual address space of the calling process. First 
argument is NULL therefore the kernel chooses the starting address of the 
mapping. Second arg is the desired length of the mapping. Third arg is the 
memory protection which is read/write in our case. Fourth arg sets the mapping 
to be invisible to other processes (MAP_PRIVATE) and also sets it to be not 
backed up by any file and is initialized to zeros (MAP_ANONYMOUS). Fifth -1 is 
just a required settlement for such an anonimity. Seventh arg 0 is ignored in 
the case of anonimity, but in other cases specifies offset. Returns the address 
of the new mapping.

write(3, "                                "..., 120) writes into file by descriptor given in 
first arg (3 in our case is the file “os/2015/info” a given in second arg sequence of given 
in thrid arg length, returns the length of written sequence if succeeds.

close(3) closes fd=3 file.

munmap(0x7f02e299a000, 65536)  unmaps the mapped memory from given address of 
given length. Returns 0 if succeeds.

unlink("os/2015/info") tries to remove a file by given path. Returns 0 if succeeds.

rmdir("os/2015/"), rmdir("os/") both try to remove a folder by given path. 
Returns 0 if succeeds.

exit_group(0) exits all process threads.

We concluded the above using manpages and google.

--------------------------------------------------

Task 2.
1)
Lets look at the following example of bad side effects that might happen:
a) First process (I) writes 1's to a file, and suddenly an interrupt happens 
(e.g. user started another process (II)). The IC notifies the CPU and CPU 
immediately saves the state of current process (I) and handles the interrupt. 
At this time, before (I) gets control back, (II) writes 0's to the very same 
file. When it is finished, the previous state is restored and (I) keeps writing 
1's (possibly) from the same point it was interrupted without "knowing" that 
there are 0's before that point now.

b) Some process is destined to print "1" every round hour, but suddenly 
interrupted. After it gets its control back, the round hour exactly passed and 
the result will not be printed until next round hour.

2)
The idea of blocking all interrupts under certain circumstances is not a very 
good one. Even though there would be no collisions (e.g. in the file write and 
other side effects), but the system will freeze (as for user) entirely until the
process is complete. Furthermore, crutial interrupts (e.g. cooling system) will 
be put on hold and may cause entire system crashes, etc.

--------------------------------------------------

Task 3.

Results: 

The three function of different operations time measurement (osm_function_time,
osm_syscall_time, osm_operation_time) are built in very similar manner: 
We begin with some initializations, input validation, then in the loop we:
1) get current time (A)
2) run the operation
3) get current time again (B)
4) calculate difference between A, B and add it to total runtime.
After the loop we calculate and return the average runtime for single operation
by dividing total runtime by total number of iterations.

The results we got are:
Option 1 (measuring one operation at a time):
Hostname:			hup-01
Number of iterations:		50000
Function:			21.320000
Trap:				289.540000
Instruction			20.860000
Function/Instruction Ratio:	1.022052
Trap/Instruction Ratio:		13.880153


The measureTime function initializes its struct, gets system vars (hostname),
and then run the above functions and saves results to the appropriate field in 
struct.

How can we tell if the measurements are good enough?
We tried to measure a time of time measurement by running two gettimeofday() 
calls one right after the other and calculate the difference of the two, and
substructing this time from measured time of the operation (with its own pair of
gettimeofday() calls).
But it seems like there are some optimizations or limitations in the precision
of the measurement and thuis we got negative time, which is highly unlogical.
Therefore we left only the operation measurement time.

To minimize the overhead of the time of time measurement, we have chosen to 
refactor the loop in every function as follows:
1) get current time (A)
2) run the operation in loop osm_iterations times
3) get current time again (B)
4) calculate difference between A, B and divide by number of iterations.

Now the results are:
Hostname:			hup-01
Number of iterations:		50000
Function:			2.220000
Trap:				250.360000
Instruction			2.160000
Function/Instruction Ratio:	1.027778
Trap/Instruction Ratio:		115.907407
